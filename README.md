# OneConfig Kotlin Forge 1.8.9 ExampleMod
- Make sure to replace every instance of `examplemod` with your mod id.
- The version specified in the build.gradle.kts file is automatically applied in the mcmod.info file and in the source code Mod annotation.
- If you get an error trying to launch the game, set the java version of the run config to 8.
- Set the java version for the gradle wrapper to 17. In IntelliJ that's CTRL + ALT + S -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Gradle -> Gradle JVM.
